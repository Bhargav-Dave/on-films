When Jennifer Garner said "You wouldn't be getting ready to marry someone, unless that someone were me..." I knew how much of a textbook romcom this movie was. The whimsical plot, the comedic middle, the "tugging at your heartstrings" interactions between the leads and all leading up to that cheesy quote towards the end of the movie. I think this might be one of the classic examples of that sweet early 2000s romantic comedies, that on the surface don't really have much to say, are fun one-time watches. Most lists you might find online classify it as a girly movie, and I still wonder if it's the correct tag. There's a self empowering message in the movie, but I wonder how the movie holds up to modern standards of it.

Jenna, upon turning 30 is not a good person. She is an adulterer, she is performing espionage on her own company and leaking sensitive information but she still is rich, living independent life and if not for her own doing has the potential to gain as much emotional support as she wants. She is dating someone conventionally attractive who is not shown to be a bad person (in fact, sleazy as he might be he appear confused at worst at her transformation). She is distant from her family and has not been home for Christmas, and yes, we all long for being with our families, but the corporate world is not always so kind. The movie however sees most, if not all of this as negative and not what she wants, in the end making her end up with what seems like a domestic existence with Matt (Mark Ruffalo's character). Whilst the movie frames this as a fairy tale ending, I wonder who it is for, is it really for Jenna? Or is it for Matt? The boy who ends up with his high  school crush, who he loved since he was 13 but held no chance with? That sounds closer to male fantasy than a story of female self empowerment. Holding Jenna in bad faith and in the end, making her want a modest, family oriented, domestic, christmas attending life is a particular and, in my opinion, a political viewpoint that the movie makes. One that imposes a particular morality on it's lead. Granted, it frames as if she wants it but one cannot deny that it veers too close to being conservative for Jenna. 

All of this being said, did I enjoy the movie? Certainly. Am I overthinking it? Most certainly. Did Billy Joel's Vienna needledrop make me emotional and wish I was back home with my parents? Absolutely. But, does it not deserve a critical eye? Definitely not.
