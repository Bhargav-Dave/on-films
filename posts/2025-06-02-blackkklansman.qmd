> \"Masks off, hoods on\"  

One thing that this joint executes masterfully is Juxtaposition. (Yes, joint, and not film -- calling a Spike Lee work anything other than a joint would be a hate crime). Juxtaposition between the Klan gatherings and the black power meetings, between a black man infiltrating a group undercover and a white man infiltrating a group undercover, between the different contexts in which violence by both the groups are situated and between the words used by both the groups. Spike Lee lays in black and white the differences in ideology on both the ends, bookended by amazing performances and tight dialogue. Tackling a serious set of topics like these, all the while maintaining a light tone at times is just masterful joint-making. Certainly a significant film, that also acts as a meta commentary on the power of films on propagating ideology -- be it Gone with the Wind, Birth of a Nation, blackspoitation cinema and Blackkklansman itself.
