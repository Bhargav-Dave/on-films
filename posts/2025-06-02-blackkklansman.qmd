One thing that this joint executes masterfully is Juxtaposition. (Yes, joint, and not film -- calling a Spike Lee work anything other than a joint would be a hate crime).

Juxtaposition between the Klan gatherings and the black power meetings, between a black man infiltrating a group undercover and a white man infiltrating a group undercover, between the different contexts in which violence by both the groups are situated and between the words used by both the groups. Not from a political perspective but from a filmmaking perspective, Lee uses shot-reverse shot between two different locations, maybe even two different times and frames what is happening on the screen as a conversation, as a dialogue. Now that's brilliant framing and a masterful use of editing. Tackling a serious set of topics like these, all the while maintaining a light tone at times is just amazing joint-making. Certainly a significant film, that also acts as a meta commentary on the power of films on propagating ideology -- be it Gone with the Wind, Birth of a Nation, blackspoitation cinema or Blackkklansman itself.
