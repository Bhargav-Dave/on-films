    "text": "When Jennifer Garner said “You wouldn’t be getting ready to marry someone, unless that someone were me…” I knew how much of a textbook romcom this movie was. The whimsical plot, the comedic middle, the “tugging at your heartstrings” interactions between the leads and all leading up to that cheesy quote towards the end of the movie. I think this might be one of the classic examples of that sweet early 2000s romantic comedies, that on the surface don’t really have much to say, are fun one-time watches. Most lists you might find online classify it as a girly movie, and I still wonder if it’s the correct tag. There’s a self empowering message in the movie, but I wonder how the movie holds up to modern standards of it.\nJenna, upon turning 30 is not a good person. She is an adulterer, she is performing espionage on her own company and leaking sensitive information but she still is rich, living independent life and if not for her own doing has the potential to gain as much emotional support as she wants. She is dating someone conventionally attractive who is not shown to be a bad person (in fact, sleazy as he might be he appear confused at worst at her transformation). She is distant from her family and has not been home for Christmas, and yes, we all long for being with our families, but the corporate world is not always so kind. The movie however sees most, if not all of this as negative and not what she wants, in the end making her end up with what seems like a domestic existence with Matt (Mark Ruffalo’s character). Whilst the movie frames this as a fairy tale ending, I wonder who it is for, is it really for Jenna? Or is it for Matt? The boy who ends up with his high school crush, who he loved since he was 13 but held no chance with? That sounds closer to male fantasy than a story of female self empowerment. Holding Jenna in bad faith and in the end, making her want a modest, family oriented, domestic, christmas attending life is a particular and, in my opinion, a political viewpoint that the movie makes. One that imposes a particular morality on it’s lead. Granted, it frames as if she wants it but one cannot deny that it veers too close to being conservative for Jenna.\nAll of this being said, did I enjoy the movie? Certainly. Am I overthinking it? Most certainly. Did Billy Joel’s Vienna needledrop make me emotional and wish I was back home with my parents? Absolutely. But, does it not deserve a critical eye? Definitely not."

    "text": "\"Santosh, there are two types of untouchables in this country, those whom no one wants to touch and those whom no one can.\"\n\nSandhya Suri’s lens delves into the patriarchy, casteism, Islamphobia, sexism and police brutality embedded within Indian society with such deft clarity that all the layers of the onion unfold to reveal the rotten core. The casual nature with which the characters of the movie behave in bigoted ways really goes on to show the pervasive nature of hateful ideology that is so ubiquitous on a day to day basis in parts of India. Like parts of a fractal, each character is a microcosm of perpetuating this established order, be it the casually Islamophobic cop that provides better quarters for the protagonist, the jaded mentor that cares a little too deeply for her, the family of her deceased husband that rejects her – all act like cogs in a machine made to take away rights from the downtrodden. The stark depiction of hate and violence against those marginalized is brutal - be it against those from the lower castes, women, the minority Muslims and the poor. It puts into perspective the fact the amount of rights and power you have is truly a function of your identity – the higher up in the socioeconomic ladder you are, the more “untouchable” you become and the same fate but in a much grim manner befalls those that are in the lower crevices of it.\nWhile I have nothing but praise for Suri’s vision and message, the fact that such a film did not come out of India and it had to be a British Indian filmmaker making it saddens me to the core. The director captures nuance like a skilled bird of prey but at times, veers dangerously close to poverty porn - my only gripe with the movie.\nRegardless, that haunting ending left me moved, as darkness engulfed the figures on screen with a fading train station, it made me wonder of the different realities lived by people less fortunate – created by a system that knows nothing but to trap whoever it can, sometimes without even touching them."

    "text": "\"Masks off, hoods on\"\n\nOne thing that this joint executes masterfully is Juxtaposition. (Yes, joint, and not film – calling a Spike Lee work anything other than a joint would be a hate crime).\nJuxtaposition between the Klan gatherings and the black power meetings, between a black man infiltrating a group undercover and a white man infiltrating a group undercover, between the different contexts in which violence by both the groups are situated and between the words used by both the groups. Not from a political perspective but from a filmmaking perspective, Lee uses shot-reverse shot between two different locations, maybe even two different times and frames what is happening on the screen as a conversation, as a dialogue. Now that’s brilliant framing and a masterful use of editing. Tackling a serious set of topics like these, all the while maintaining a light tone at times is just amazing joint-making. Certainly a significant film, that also acts as a meta commentary on the power of films on propagating ideology – be it Gone with the Wind, Birth of a Nation, blackspoitation cinema or Blackkklansman itself."
