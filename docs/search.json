    "text": "\"Santosh, there are two types of untouchables in this country, those whom no one wants to touch and those whom no one can.\"\n\nSandhya Suri’s lens delves into the patriarchy, casteism, Islamphobia, sexism and police brutality embedded within Indian society with such deft clarity that all the layers of the onion unfold to reveal the rotten core. The casual nature with which the characters of the movie behave in bigoted ways really goes on to show the pervasive nature of hateful ideology that is so ubiquitous on a day to day basis in parts of India. Like parts of a fractal, each character is a microcosm of perpetuating this established order, be it the casually Islamophobic cop that provides better quarters for the protagonist, the jaded mentor that cares a little too deeply for her, the family of her deceased husband that rejects her – all act like cogs in a machine made to take away rights from the downtrodden. The stark depiction of hate and violence against any form of marginalized group is brutal - be it against those from the lower castes, women, the minority Muslims and the poor. It puts into perspective the fact the amount of rights and power you have is truly a function of your identity – the higher up in the socioeconomic ladder you are, the more “untouchable” you become and the same fate but in a much grim manner befalls those that are in the lower crevices of it.\nWhile I have nothing but praise for Suri’s vision and message, the fact that such a film did not come out of India and it had to be a British Indian filmmaker making it saddens me to the core. The director captures nuance like a skilled bird of prey but at times, veers dangerously close to poverty porn - my only gripe with the movie.\nRegardless, that haunting ending left me moved, as darkness engulfed the figures on screen with a fading train station, it made me wonder of the different realities lived by people less fortunate – created by a system that knows nothing but to trap whoever it can, sometimes without even touching them."
